<!-- > ### A batch of 7 manufactured items contains 2 defective items. Suppose 4 items are selected at random from the batch. What is the probability that 1 of these items are defective?
> >
> > ## Solution
> > 
> >There are $$\binom{7}{4}$$ possible ways to chose $$4$$ different items from
the population of $$7$$ items which will be our denominator. Now we need
to know how many of those possibilities have $$1$$ bad ones in them for
our numerator. If there's $$2$$ total defective ones, then there are
$$\binom{2}{1}$$. Therefore the probability P is:\
> > $$P = \frac{\binom{2}{1}}{\binom{7}{4}}$$\
>We simplify the binomial coefficients using their definition in terms of factorials.\
> > Using the formula $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$, we have:\
> >$$\binom{2}{1} = \frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = \frac{2}{1} = 2$$\
> >$$\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{6} = 7 \times 5 = 35$$\
> >Substituting these values back into the expression $$P$$, we get:\
> >$$P = \frac{\binom{2}{1}}{\binom{7}{4}} = \frac{2}{35}$$\
> >Therefore, the value of $$P$$ is $$\frac{2}{35}$$.

> ### 10 books are placed in random order on a bookshelf. Find the probability of 4 given books being side by side.
> >
> > ## Solution
> >
> >To find the probability of 4 given books being side by side when 10 books are placed in a random order on a bookshelf, we calculate the total number of possible arrangements and the number of arrangements where the 4 given books are together.\
> >Total number of possible arrangements:\
> >Since there are 10 books, the total number of possible arrangements is given by the factorial of 10, denoted as $$10!$$.\
> >Arrangements where the 4 given books are together:\
> >Consider the 4 given books as a single entity. So, we have 7 remaining books and the group of 4 given books, which can be arranged in $$(7 + 1)!$$ ways. However, within the group of 4 given books, they can be arranged in $$4!$$ ways. Therefore, the number of arrangements where the 4 given books are together is $$(7 + 1)! \times 4!$$.\
> >Now, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable arrangements (where the 4 given books are together) by the total number of possible arrangements:\
> >Probability = $$\frac{\text{Number of arrangements with 4 given books together}{\text{Total number of possible arrangements}} =\frac{8! \times 4!}{10!}$$\
> >Therefore, the probability of 4 given books being side by side is\
> > $$\frac{8! \times 4!}{10!}$$.
