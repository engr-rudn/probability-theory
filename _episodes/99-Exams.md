## Mid-Semester Exam Ac.Year 2022/23

> ### A batch of 7 manufactured items contains 2 defective items. Suppose 4 items are selected at random from the batch. What is the probability that 1 of these items are defective?

> >There are $$\binom{7}{4}$$ possible ways to chose $$4$$ different items from
the population of $$7$$ items which will be our denominator. Now we need
to know how many of those possibilities have $$1$$ bad ones in them for
our numerator. If there's $$2$$ total defective ones, then there are
$$\binom{2}{1}$$. Therefore the probability P is:\
> > $$P = \frac{\binom{2}{1}}{\binom{7}{4}}$$\
>We simplify the binomial coefficients using their definition in terms of factorials.\
> > Using the formula $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$, we have:\
> >$$\binom{2}{1} = \frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = \frac{2}{1} = 2$$\
> >$$\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{6} = 7 \times 5 = 35$$\
> >Substituting these values back into the expression $$P$$, we get:\
> >$$P = \frac{\binom{2}{1}}{\binom{7}{4}} = \frac{2}{35}$$\
> >Therefore, the value of $$P$$ is $$\frac{2}{35}$$.
